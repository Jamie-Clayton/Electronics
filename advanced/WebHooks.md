# Web Hooks

> A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application > with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application.
> The format is usually JSON. The request is done as an HTTP POST request.

The approach is used in software programing to enable other software and systems to respond to external systems.  E.g. Sensor detecting movement would publish a web hook that advertised that movement to a security system so  appropriate action can be taken by that system.
