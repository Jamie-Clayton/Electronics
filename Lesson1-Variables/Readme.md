# Overview

* Introduction to Raspberry pi
* Variables and their use in software programs
* Prototyping with breadboards
* Practical - Ways to switch on lights

## What is Raspberry Pi

* Very cheap and surprisingly powerful
* Enables learning electronics theory
* Lots of project ideas online
* Includes an operating system - Linux (but you can run windows 10 on newer hardware)
* Interesting sensors are available for 'robotics'

## Software and Electronics

### Under the covers of Software

* Binary - 1 or 0
* Machine language - [CPU level instructions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-instructions)
* [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) - developed 1972 maps efficiently to Machine Language . C is also very popular with electronics because of it's performance.
* Python - 1990, v3 released 2008 and v3.9 released October 2020. It is an easy language to learn.
 ['Zen of Python'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)
  * Beautiful is better than ugly
  * Explicit is better than implicit
  * Simple is better than complex
  * Complex is better than complicated
  * Readability counts

### Programing Introduction

All software languages involve a syntax that you need to learn. Software does what you tell it, so it's always a human that causes the software to fail.

1. You write text instructions
2. Compile those instructions to confirm they are correct
3. Run the code file
4. Confirm the behaviour of the code

### Variables

Jump into Visual Studio Code and run some python code to understand variables and how they may be used in a software program.

* [Introduction to variables](./variables.py)
* [Introduction to time](./time.py)

### Running software on Raspberry Pi

![Red LED](https://www.adeept.com/u_file/1804/products/14/72f3eb6e4a.jpg.500x500.jpg)

* Run the LED 01, LED 02, LED 03 python examples that have been downloaded from the [Adeept code repository](https://github.com/adeept/Adeept_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_Python_Code_for_RPi).
