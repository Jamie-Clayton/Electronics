# Mens Shed Weather Station Project

## Inputs

- Compass
- GPS
- Wind Speed/Direction
- Barometer
- Air Pressure Sensor
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rain Gauge
- Weather vane
- Solar radiation sensor
- Air quality

## Optional Equipment

Extra temperature and air quality sensors for 3 separate shed sections (Woodwork, Dirty Metal Shed, Art Shed) to monitor the health of members at the shed.  Garden sensor for soil moisture may also be considered.

- Mounting Standoffs ?? (https://www.ebay.com.au/c/2166276838)
- Pi Zero + Temperature, Humidity + Air quality for each Shed (Woodwork, Dirty Metal Shed, Art Shed)
- Pi Zero + Battery + Solar for Garden soil moisture

## Outputs

- Led Panel

## Purchase Options

We are trying to keep the cost of all the parts of the project to less than $500. A display to be installed near the Club Kitchen or Entrance from the weather station and sensors.
